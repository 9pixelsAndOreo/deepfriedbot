# Deepfried Bot and wave bot
9pixels' bot for Hack 4 Pan


Hi Pan!

This is the bot that 9pixel made.

I call this the social bot. Each command is a way to communicate with the bot.

DISCLAMER: BOT MIGHT BE OFFLINE AFTER COMPETITION. MEANING THAT IT WILL NOT BE USED FOR ANYTHING (UNLESS PAN WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IT)
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

The prefix for the Deepfried Bot is $.

All sorts of commands make the bot be useful and respond. Something like $fry will make the Deepfried Bot say Let's use the frying pan! .

But be careful with the bad words you say because you'll be warned by the bot or even kicked by a mod or admin. (FUNCTION NOT FINISHED YET)

There are more commands such as $about pan and $sub.

Here's the full list (more commands coming soon):

Basically Deepfried Bot is just a bot which executes the commands you type (just like any bot).
